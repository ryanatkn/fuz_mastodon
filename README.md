> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still early, and its APIs will change.
> The code is fairly low quality, but the UX for embedding toots should work.

Features:

- embed toots without authentication
- nested replies
- spoiler warnings are behind `<details>`
- allowlisting via likes by the toot author
- customizable caching

Limitations:

- read-only (no authentication is supported)
- only one view/layout
- allowlisting is hardcoded to the original toot author's likes

Planned:

- multiple views and layouts
- a more complete and robust wrapper around the Mastodon API
